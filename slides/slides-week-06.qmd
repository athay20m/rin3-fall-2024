- How to import projects from GitHub to RStudio using GitHub Desktop and RStudio

## Why Learn Git + GitHub?

>  I understand the basics of how github functions but I would really appreciate some clarity about a real-world practical application of how someone would use github in their work. To me, it seems like github adds a lot of extra steps to do something that can more easily be accomplished by writing detailed notes to myself in my syntax, or using the # character to zero out syntax that I previously developed but no longer want to use. Thanks for your insights!
