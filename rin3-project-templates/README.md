This is a repository with examples of assignments and project templates for the R in 3 Months program.

## What are assignments for and what might they look like?

Assignments are a way for you to ask questions and get feedback. Please spend no longer than 3 hours on an assignment. If you find yourself stuck and feeling like you don't want to turn in code that doesn't work - stop! This is the perfect time to turn it in. Please do not delete code that doesn't work. Use code comments to make notes about what exactly you were trying to do and what isn't working. Your coach will review your code for general style and also help you fix those bits of broken code and understand what was going on. It's ok to include lots of questions, but your coach may focus on just two of them. You'll receive text feedback, video feedback, or both!

Unsure what an assignment might look like? Take a look at the example assignments folder, which contains examples of the first three assignments. 

You'll find the examples have a few things in common: 
- there are comments separating the different sections of code
- there are comments explaining what each query or plot is doing and what question it's solving - there are comments after queries specifying answers to questions
- they all follow the same project structure, with the same folders and the same naming convention

Remember that the code shared here is just an example, and you should not copy it and turn it in as your own assignment.
